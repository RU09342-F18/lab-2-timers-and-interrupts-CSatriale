# Lab 3: Timers and Interrupts

# README
The duration of a button press determines the amount of time and LED blinks. There are two interrupts, one that allows the LED to blink on the edges of a clock and the other checks for a button press. Once the button is released, the time since first press becomes the reset value for the LED. The code differs in pins for the MSP430G2553 and F5529. The inputs for the LED on the 5523 and 5529 is P1.0. The buttons for 553 and 5529 are P1.3 and P2.1 respectively.
